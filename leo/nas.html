        <p>At home I have a 60TB NAS server running TrueNAS Scale. I use it mostly to download YouTube channels that I enjoy, back up my computer, and store all my recordings of video games, or calls with friends.</p>
        <p>The server itself consists of 6 12TB Seagate EXOS hard drives, because the 12TB model was the cheapest per terabyte. The reason why the server has 60TB of storage, and not 72TB of storage (because 6*12=72) is because it has 1 VDEV. What this means is that one hard drive could fail, and as long as a second hard drive doesn't fail, no data is lost. This is good for data protection, but results in the storage capacity of one drive being used to maintain the VDEV.</p>
        <p>I got the NAS server because I found myself being quite the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/">datahoarder</a>," asking for a new external hard drive every birthday and Christmas, because all of the internal hard drive slots on my computer were already filled up with hard drives. Data became strewn across my computer, with some things being on one drive, and some things being on another drive, and it generally lead to confusion that I just didn't want to deal with. Not to mention, a lot of the internal hard drives were old, and were scowered from older, unused PCs and laptops throughout the house. They could fail at any moment, and it would result in data being lost. What I decided to do is buy this NAS server with money I had saved up, and since then, my storing of data has become a much "cleaner" process.</p>
