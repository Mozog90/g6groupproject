    I got an email from a company that I booked a flight with a while ago. They said they had a data breach and some of my info might have been leaked, like my name, email, and credit card number. I was so freaked out and worried, like how did this happen and what can I do to protect myself?
    
    This is just one way that our online data can get messed up, and how to deal with it. Data breaches are when people who shouldn’t get into our data, like hackers or scammers, and take or expose our stuff, like personal info or money. Data breaches can happen for different reasons, like hacking, phishing, malware, or mistakes. Data breaches can be bad for us and for the companies we trust, like we can get our identity stolen, lose money, or get a bad reputation.
    
    There are some things we can do to prevent or lower the chance of data breaches, like:
    
    Save your data often and safely, like on a hard drive or online.
    Keep your devices safe from damage, theft, or people snooping around, like with locks, alarms, or passwords.
    Learn and follow the rules of data security, like using strong passwords, not clicking on weird links or files, or telling someone if something looks fishy.
    Keep your computer and software up to date and clean, using antivirus and anti-malware programs, firewalls, or VPNs.
    Encrypting your sensitive data, especially when transmitting or storing it online.
    Fix any problems or bugs in your software as soon as you can, so that they don’t make your data vulnerable.
    
    These are some of the things we can do to prevent or minimize the damage of data breaches. But nothing is perfect, and data breaches can still happen even if we try our best. So we should always be careful and ready, and act fast if we have a data breach.
