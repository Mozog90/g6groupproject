       <p>Mount Baker, a striking presence in the northern reaches of Washington State's Cascade Range, stands as a testament to the region's volcanic legacy and natural grandeur. 
           Towering at 10,781 feet (3,286 meters) above sea level, it commands attention with its snow-capped peak and formidable glaciers, earning it the nickname "Koma Kulshan" by the indigenous Lummi people. 
           As one of the most glaciated peaks in the contiguous United States, Mount Baker offers a playground for outdoor enthusiasts, from alpine climbers tackling its challenging routes to skiers carving through its powder-covered slopes. 
           Surrounded by lush forests, alpine meadows, and sparkling lakes, Mount Baker beckons adventurers to explore its diverse ecosystems and bask in the breathtaking vistas of the Pacific Northwest.
